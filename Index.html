                <p class="center"> 1.Types of Catering Services:

                    Full-Service Catering: This involves a comprehensive catering experience, including menu planning,
                    food preparation, delivery, setup, serving, and cleanup. Full-service caterers often handle large
                    events like weddings and corporate functions.
                    Drop-Off Catering: Caterers prepare the food and deliver it to the event location, leaving the
                    setup, serving, and cleanup to the event organizers.
                    Buffet Catering: Food is set up on tables, and guests serve themselves. Buffet catering can be more
                    cost-effective and offer a variety of food options.
                    Plated Catering: A formal dining experience where waitstaff serve plated meals to guests at their
                    tables.
                    Food Truck Catering: Food trucks provide on-site cooking and serve guests directly, which can add a
                    unique and interactive element to events.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">Bulk ordering refers to the process of purchasing a large quantity of goods or
                    products from a supplier or manufacturer. This is often done by businesses, organizations, or
                    individuals who need a significant amount of a particular item. Bulk ordering typically offers
                    certain advantages such as cost savings due to economies of scale, reduced shipping and handling
                    fees per unit, and the ability to maintain sufficient inventory for ongoing operations or events.


                    Here are some key points to consider when it comes to bulk ordering</p>
                <p class="center"> 1. Cost Savings: Buying in bulk usually results in lower per-unit costs. Suppliers
                    often
                    offer discounts for large volume orders since they can reduce production and packaging costs
                </p>
                <p class="center">
                    2. Logistics and Shipping: Ordering in bulk can reduce shipping costs on a per-item basis. However,
                    it's important to consider storage space and any potential storage costs.
